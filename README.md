# botzone_amazons

This project is a JAVA re-implementation of [BOTZONE](cn.botzone.org) that's created and maintained by PKU.

## Dev Plan

- Design the classes and loading procedure
- Implement the CLI interface using `ChessBoard`, `ChessPiece` and `Amazons` only
- Implement the GUI (hard and unfamiliar)
- Implement the AI feature inside `BotAmazons`
- Implement LAN multiplayer (future)
- Implement online multiplayer (easy peasy after LAN)
